# Scripts
General, useful, short GNU/Linux bash and POSIX scripts to add to PATH.

If a directory starts with _luke_ it contains scripts originally written by [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/) as part of his [archi3 rice](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/tree/archi3), but which could have been modified by me.

Required by [my rice](https://github.com/kpatel28/KAR).
